					<p>
						After conducting needfinding interviews with major stakeholders and extreme users, my group and I had several breakdowns and design opportunities to work with. We used storyboarding to narrow down the options and come up with a focused point of view for our app, as well as establish our target user.

					<p>
						We used paper prototypes to design our interface. We referred to Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to evaluate our design and ensure good usability and flow. From this, we had a list of violations that needed to be fixed, so we used severity ratings to rank the importance of each violation.
