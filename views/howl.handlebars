				<p>About: Howl is a mobile app designed to meet the needs of undergradudate students looking for helpful advice from their peers on how to build successful career paths. Inspired by Yelp's review system, Howl collects advice from students who have gotten jobs and internships related to their fields of study, so that their peers can see and learn from the paths that they took to achieve success.</p>

				<p>Role: UX Designer</p>
				<p>Duration: August-September 2015</p>
				<p>Collaborators: Xu Cheng, Tracy Nham, Ryan Tomimitsu, Emily Yew
				<p>Type: Mobile Application</p>
				<p>Tools Used: Photoshop, JustInMind Prototyper, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap</p>
				<p>Methods: Needfinding, Storyboarding, Wireframes

				<p>Process: We kicked off the design process by creating storyboards, to establish the target user of our app. Then, we created a list of questions to use for research, to gather more in-depth information about the needs of our users. From here, we developed use cases, which helped frame our design decisions throughout the development of the app.</p>

				<p>We each developed our own low-fidelity prototypes, and used parallel prototyping methods. This process kept our group open to more ideas than we would have come up with if we had only created one prototype.</p>

				<p>We presented our prototypes, and the main feedback we received revolved around concerns about validity. How would users know if the advice they were reading was from a reliable source? We addressed this issue by including information about the reviewer that validates the advice they're giving.</p>
